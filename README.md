# scamcast
A tiny script for scraping and emailing Comcast data usage to an email address of your choosing.

You'll need to install phantomjs and edit the config.json file.  Uses a sendgrid account for sending mail.

As of 2017 I haven't run this in a long time since Comcast dramatically increased their data limits and improved their notifications, so there's a good chance this no longer works.
